# Smart Embedded Environmental Control & Access System

## Overview
This project implements a multi-sensor embedded control system using an Arduino-based platform. 
The system integrates environmental sensing, state-based decision logic, actuator control, and 
real-time serial data logging.

The design emphasizes modularity, hardware–software co-design, and system-level thinking, 
mirroring real-world embedded and hardware engineering workflows.
