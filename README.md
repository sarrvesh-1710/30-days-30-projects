# 30-Day Embedded Systems & Hardware Engineering Portfolio

## Overview
This repository documents a structured 30-day progression of embedded systems projects, starting from fundamental digital I/O and advancing to a fully integrated multi-sensor control system. The goal of this project series was to build strong foundations in embedded hardware, real-time control, system integration, and hardware–software co-design, with relevance to modern chip, FPGA, and embedded engineering roles.

Each project incrementally introduced new concepts such as digital logic, analog signal processing, state machines, sensor fusion, actuator control, and real-time data logging. The final capstone integrates these skills into a single system-level design.
